# TrackEDT
This is a tool to extract edits from Word documents with changes tracked.

The tool will pull any deletions, insertions, text moved from, and text moved to and compile the data into a csv file.

This tool can be useful for editing practice, research, and pedagogy because it allows users to more easily compare edits made across documents.

We introduced the tool at the 88th conference of the Association for Business Communication in Denver, Colorado, on October 27, 2023.

As of that time, the tool is still in alpha mode. We invite users to download the tool, test it, and let us know of any bugs they find.
